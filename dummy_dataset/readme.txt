For your generated dataset (covering 2025-04-14 to 2025-04-20), the data was created for three 2-hour sessions each day, based on your request:
ðŸ•’ Time Ranges per Day (in local time, UTC+5:30 assumed):

    Morning session: 06:00:00 â†’ 07:59:55

    Afternoon session: 12:00:00 â†’ 13:59:55

    Evening session: 18:00:00 â†’ 19:59:55

Data was generated at 5-second intervals, so each 2-hour session contains:

    2 hours Ã— 60 minutes Ã— 60 seconds / 5 = 1440 readings per session

Thus, each day has 3 Ã— 1440 = 4320 entries, and the full week includes:

    4320 Ã— 7 = 30,240 readings
